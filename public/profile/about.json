    "about": "Hello! I'm Adam Tuor, a data analyst based in Toronto, Ontario. With a strong background in education, I bring a unique perspective to my work as a data analyst. Previously, I worked as an English teacher at Chungdahm Learning Institute in South Korea, where I developed strong communication skills and the ability to adapt lesson plans to address challenges effectively. This teaching experience has equipped me with the skills to convey data-driven insights to diverse audiences.\n\nI have a passion for deriving insights from data and creating interactive web applications using frameworks like Flask, D3.js, and Leaflet.js. Proficient in Python, SQL, and data visualization, I excel at analyzing complex information and transforming it into meaningful visualizations.\n\nThroughout my study, I've successfully completed projects such as analyzing school performance with Pandas DataFrames and developing interactive dashboards for crime patterns and biodiversity datasets. I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments and enjoy finding creative solutions through data analysis.\n\nOutside of work, I enjoy activities like going to the beach, going on bike rides, and snowboarding in the winter. I'm currently pursuing a Data Analytics certificate from the University of Toronto to further enhance my skills.\n\nLet's connect and create meaningful insights together!",
